# **Dynamic City Animation**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a visually engaging animation of a dynamic cityscape. It includes moving cars, clouds, buildings, a sun, a moon, and even shooting stars! The scene transitions through various times of the day, from sunrise to night, offering a realistic experience of city life.

## **Features**  
1. **Day-Night Cycle**: Watch the sun rise, the day brighten, and the moonlight take over at night.  
2. **Interactive Sky**: Stars twinkle at night, clouds move across the sky, and the sky colors change dynamically.  
3. **Moving Elements**:  
   - **Buildings**: Realistic city buildings, some with clock towers and windows that light up at night.  
   - **Cars**: Colorful cars drive on the roads in both directions.  
   - **Shooting Stars**: Occasionally, you'll see a shooting star in the night sky!  
4. **Interactive Mouse Trail**: Move your mouse to create glowing particle effects.  
5. **Realistic Shadows**: Shadows cast by buildings change with the time of day.
